The environment variables AUTH_SECRET, AUTH_GITHUB_ID, and AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET are used in the context of integrating GitHub authentication into applications, particularly when using libraries like Auth.js. Here's a breakdown of each:

#### AUTH_SECRET:

This is a secret key used to secure the session and sign cookies. It should be kept confidential and not exposed publicly. The value is typically a string, such as "changeMe".

#### AUTH_GITHUB_ID:

This is the Client ID obtained from registering an application in GitHub's developer settings. It is a public identifier for your OAuth application within GitHub.

#### AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET:

This is the Client Secret obtained from registering an application in GitHub's developer settings. It should be kept secure and never exposed publicly. This secret is used to authenticate your application when making requests to GitHub's API
